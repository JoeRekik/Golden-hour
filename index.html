      <h1>The Golden Hour — Private Financial Intermediary &amp; Market Insights</h1>
      <p>
        Smart trading starts with understanding your market’s rhythm. I’m <strong>Youssef Rekik</strong>,
        a private financial intermediary specialising in data‑driven market analysis.
        Through my project <strong>Golden Hour</strong>, I combine business intelligence,
        forecasting models and financial insight to identify the most strategic trading hours — the moments when liquidity and volatility converge.

      <h2>About the Golden Hour Project</h2>
      <p>
        The Golden Hour project was designed to modernise the way investors analyse the Tunisian stock exchange (BVMT) and global assets like Bitcoin.
        As a private intermediary, I bridge institutional‑grade analytics and user‑friendly visualisation.
        Using the CRISP‑DM methodology, I process historical quotations, forecast market movements and build interactive dashboards that make professional trading tools accessible to everyone.
